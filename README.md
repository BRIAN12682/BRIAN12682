Mobile and web development and design. Machine learning.
Automation, Data-science, 

I started my programming  career with mainly the web-systems development in Django. i further progressed it with Mobile app development with flutter then web development but after some time i found it interesting to integrate applications with machine learning in order to make them more efficient and productive and carry out automation projects using tkinter and pygame. i have worked alo on embedded systems programming and so many other projects in the due course.
